# Airplane Crash Fatalities Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores airplane crash fatalities over time to uncover patterns across aircraft types, years, severity levels, and total casualties (both aboard and on the ground).

Using Power BI, the analysis focuses on transforming a complex and sensitive dataset into clear, meaningful insights through effective visualization and storytelling.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Data Visualization
- Analytical Storytelling

## Key Objectives
- Identify trends showing when and where most airplane crashes occurred
- Compare fatal and non-fatal incidents to understand safety improvements over time
- Track key metrics such as total passengers aboard, fatalities, and ground deaths
- Present insights using dynamic KPIs and intuitive visuals

## Key Insights
- Fatal crashes accounted for approximately **98.67%** of all recorded incidents
- Certain periods and aircraft categories experienced higher severity levels
- Visual KPIs made it easier to assess overall casualties and impact at a glance

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the critical importance of continued aviation safety measures. The project strengthened my Power BI skills, particularly in data modeling, dashboard design, and communicating insights from sensitive datasets.
